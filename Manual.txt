Step By Step Guide.
	1)Entering a tonic.
		i)Type a valid music note at the prompt and press enter.
	2)Choose a mode of operation.
		i)Enter the number associated with a given menu option and press enter.
		ii)Random Based On Scale.
			i)Chords are generated randomly given the note and scale/mode selected.
			ii)The chords selected will be random based upon possible chords in the scale.
		iii)Genre Based.
			i)Choose a genre
			ii)Chords and chord progression are pre-selected from a key given your input tonic.
		iv)Manual Entry.
			i)Chords are manually input by user given the tonic and scale/mode selected.
			ii)User can specify what chords to add, the amount of chord tones, modifiers such as sus2,
				lengths of notes in midi, and for substitutions user specifies the tonic and scale of
				the substitute chord.
	3)Random Based On Scale

		ii)Type the number of chords you want to generate, 1 or more and press enter.
		iii)Type the number of chord tones for every chord to have, press enter.
		iv)Type y if you want the progression to start on your chosen tonic or n to not, press enter.
			i)At this point the program will print the tonic, scale, scale chords, and the chords that were generated.
		v)Type y to export .txt file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
		vii)Type y to export .mid file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Type a beats per minute value for the midi file to be, press enter.
			ii)Type r for each chord to play a random amount of time, or f to select a fixed amount of time for every chord, press enter.
				i)If fixed was chosen, type how long you would lie every note to last as a whole note > 0, press enter.
			iii)Type a number associated with the genre of music you want reflected.
			iv)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
	4)Genre Based
		i)Type the number associated with the genre you want and press enter.
		ii)Type the number of chord tones for every chord to have, press enter.
			i)At this point the program will print the tonic, scale, scale chords, and the chords that were generated.
		iii)Type y to export .txt file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
		iv)Type y to export .mid file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Type a beats per minute value for the midi file to be, press enter.
			ii)Type r for each chord to play a random amount of time, or f to select a fixed amount of time for every chord, press enter.
				i)If fixed was chosen, type how long you would like every note to last as a whole note > 0, press enter.
			i)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
	5)Manual Entry
		i)Type the number associated with the scale/mode you want and press enter.
		ii)At the prompt type Note,ChordTones,Midi Length,Modifier(s),Alt Scale Tonic,Alt Scale Number(Optional) then press enter.
			i)Note is a valid note.
			ii)ChordTones is a 0<whole number<8.
			iii)Midi Length is a whole number > 0.
			iv)Modifier(s) are modifiers separated by ,(s) from this list:[sus2, sus4, 6, m6, 9, 11, 13, add9, add11, add13, none].
				i)If you are using no modifiers, Type none.
				ii)you can string multiple modifiers together however some combinations don't make sense musically
				 such as having 9 and add9 as modifiers.
			v)If substitution is occurring enter the tonic/note for the substitution key.
			vi)If substitution is occurring enter the scale/mode number from the list above.
			vii)Ensure every option is separated by a ,.
		iii)If you want to remove the last added chord, type r then enter to remove it.
		iv)If you want to stop adding chords and move to the next step type q then press enter.
		v)Type y to export .txt file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
		vi)Type y to export .mid file containing this information, n to skip export, press enter.
			i)Type a beats per minute value for the midi file to be, press enter.
			ii)Since Midi lengths are specified when a chord is added, that option is not needed here.
			iii)Type a number associated with the genre of music you want reflected.
			iv)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
			iv)Exported files are located at CurrentWorkingDirectory/Music
				i)If Music folder does not exist, it will be created.
